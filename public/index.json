[{"content":"Introduction For building your blog-site today, what you need is just network connection and 30 minutes, using the following tools:\nHugo Github pages These two services are quite enough for you to start. The first step is to build the site. The instructions in Hugo document is quite clear. Read the doc.\nAdd $\\LaTeX$ Support Use MathJax and handle the underline issue.\nsee jiguankai\u0026rsquo;s blog (I just copy paste the solution XD).\nAdd Photos. You can view your current blog folder as a tiny subsite. Put resource under it and reference them as you like.\n![cute-cat](images/cute-cat.jpg) The effect is:\nNote: you should store you article as post/your-post/index.md rather than post/your-pos/your-post.md\nAdd Non-HTML Attachments. Just attach a link :)\nRestrictions Github is not a good place to store your data. You should consider migrating your website to a server once you get familiar with Hugo (Renting a server with public ip costs around $50 a year). ParapMod or other theme is a good place to start, but you should consider managing your own theme if you want to take a change.
